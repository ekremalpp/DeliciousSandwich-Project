# Project Title
DeliciousSandwich

## Description of the Project
DeliciousSandwich Ordering System is a user-interactive application that supports the creation
of orders for customized sandwiches by the user themselves. The system will guide in choosing 
the kind of bread, size of the bread, toppings, sauces the user would want in his sandwich,
and if he wants it toasted or not. Users can prepare their orders, see an overview of their choices,
and calculate the total price of their meal

The system is designed for users to:
1) Create New Orders
2) Customize Sandwiches(meats,cheeses,regular topping..)
3) Add Extras (drinks and chips)
4) Calculate Prices
5) Order Confirmation and Receipt Generation
6) Cancel orders
